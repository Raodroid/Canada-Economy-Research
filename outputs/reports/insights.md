# Initial Insights: Oil Price Impact on Canadian Employment

## Key Finding: 1-2 Month Lag Effect
- **Correlation at Lag 0:** 0.076 (weak immediate effect)
- **Correlation at Lag 1:** 0.362 (strongest effect)
- **Correlation at Lag 2:** 0.270 (moderate effect)
- **Correlation after Lag 3:** Near zero (effect dissipates)

## Economic Interpretation
Canadian employers take approximately **1-2 months** to adjust hiring/firing decisions in response to oil price changes. This suggests:
1. **Decision lag:** Companies wait to confirm price trends
2. **Operational lag:** Hiring/firing processes take time
3. **Sectoral variation:** Energy sector likely reacts faster

## Data Quality Notes
- Period: January 2010 - December 2024 (180 months)
- Oil prices: WTI Crude monthly averages
- Employment: Canada total employment, seasonally adjusted
- Merge successful with proper date alignment

## Next Analysis Directions
1. **Shock-specific analysis:** How did major events (2014 crash, COVID-19) affect employment?
2. **Sectoral breakdown:** Energy vs. non-energy employment
3. **Regional analysis:** Alberta/Calgary vs. national averages
4. **Policy implications:** Optimal timing for employment stabilization policies

## Relevance to Singapore
While Canada exports oil and Singapore imports it, both economies face:
- **Commodity price volatility** affecting employment
- **Time lags** in economic adjustment
- **Need for proactive policy responses**

**Next step:** Compare with Singapore's import price-employment relationship.
